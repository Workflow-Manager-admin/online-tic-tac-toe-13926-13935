# Tic Tac Toe Frontend – Codebase Overview

## Framework and Technology

This project is a lightweight web-based frontend for playing Tic Tac Toe, developed using the React JavaScript framework (React 18.x). It is set up with `react-scripts` for development, build, and testing, and does not use any heavyweight UI library, relying instead on custom, modern CSS.

## Main Project Structure

- `src/index.js`: Entry point that mounts the React application to the DOM.
- `src/App.js`: Main application component. Implements the entire user interface and game logic as a single-page interactive React app.
- `src/App.css`: Contains all custom CSS for layout, theme (light, modern), and responsive design.
- `package.json`: Project manifest, listing dependencies (`react`, `react-dom`, `react-scripts`) and scripts for building, running, and testing the app.

    ├── index.css   # Basic CSS resets, font setup
    └── ...         # Additional support files (logo, test setup, etc.)
```

## Main Components & Features (as implemented)

All major UI and functional parts are implemented directly in `App.js` as React function components:

- **Square**: Represents a single cell on the tic tac toe board (button element). Highlights as part of a winning trio.
- **Board**: Arranges 9 Square components in a 3x3 grid, handles rendering win highlight.
- **PlayerIndicators**: Clearly shows the current player's turn, highlighting with the accent color and bold font.
- **ResultDisplay**: Shows the outcome ("Winner: X", "Draw!") using clear, styled messages.
- **App**: The root component, ties everything together, manages game state, and provides controls (including Restart functionality).

### Game Logic

- The application manages the board state (9 squares), turn tracking (X or O), winner calculation (with highlight for winning line), and draw detection.
- Users interact by clicking squares; moves are validated and ignored if the cell is filled or the game is over.
- The **Restart Game** button resets the board and turn.

## Theming & Layout

- Theme colors (`--primary`, `--secondary`, `--accent`) are centralized as CSS variables in `App.css`, enabling easy customization.
- The UI follows a modern, minimal design: centered board, bold colors, outlined board, smooth highlight transitions.
- Responsive layout adapts the board and components for mobile screens.

## Other Key Details

- No networking or multiplayer logic exists in the current (local) implementation; all play happens client-side.
- The codebase is intentionally kept simple and modular for clarity and easy modification.
- ESLint and testing setup files are present for basic code quality and test support.
- The footer is intentionally minimal and can be extended or customized as needed.

## Summary

This `tic_tac_toe_frontend` is a single-page application focused on clean UX, code simplicity, and rapid loading for an engaging, modern synchronous Tic Tac Toe game on the web. Its structure makes it suitable for extension into multiplayer or server-connected versions in the future.
